# Practice Sessions

## 08-05-2019

Completed, took 71 minutes, 7 tests

* Did fine with linux commands
* Doing just MD in VIM has been a pain. I can see why people like it, but i just keep hitting the wrong shit
* :qa! is your friend as it turns out!
* had a much better map/reduce pattern this time through
* 2 util functions, probably unavoidable
* final method feels trivial, but might be worth testing for shape? i don't know.
* need to decide what my output needs to be in a test BEFORE writing the test
* this challenge should present final expected output, will add that.


## Example 08-05-2019

Completed, Took 500m
- I really could do better if I could remember VIM operations. I had to Google it every single time. 
- Next time, I should test as i go with the more complex Object.assign() type chains.
- May want to make more specific folder structure next time
